Sister Street Stage is an outdoor stage and event space at 819 Sister Street (corner of Dauphine) in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. 

The location is adjacent to the levee where the Industrial Canal shipping channel meets the Mississippi River. You can sit on the top of the levee and watch the show and watch the ships go by at the same time.

The space is simply a large corner lot with a covered wooden stage. Originally built to host a wedding, the stage has since been used to showcase New Orleans' local music.
